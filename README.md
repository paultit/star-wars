# star-wars
# This is an Angular application designed to visualize data from the Star Wars public API. The app provides access to a list of movies, detailed information about the movies, and simulates the authentication process.
# Authentication: Access to all sections of the app requires authentication. Users have different roles with varying levels of permissions, restricting their access to certain functionalities. Authentication is achieved using a simulated JWT token, which is stored in localStorage. The token is automatically removed when it expires.
# Dashboard: The main page of the app displays a list of all movies sorted by episode_id. Each movie is presented as a card with a title, description, producers, and release date. Users can click the "Details" button to see # detailed information about the movie.
# Movie Page: The page displaying detailed movie information includes the movie's title, description, release date, and lists of starships, people, and planets associated with the movie. The lists are presented in tables with the ability to sort by name.
